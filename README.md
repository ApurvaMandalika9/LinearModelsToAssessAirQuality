# Linear Models To Assess Air Quality

Each row of the data corresponds to a sample and the columns include the following information:
1. NMHC(GT): hourly averaged overall Non Metanic HydroCarbons concentration in microg/m3
2. C6H6(GT): hourly averaged Benzene concentration in microg/m3
3. C6H6(GT): hourly averaged Benzene concentration in microg/m3
4. PT08.S2(NMHC): hourly averaged sensor response to NMHC
5. NOx(GT): hourly averaged NOx concentration in ppb
6. PT08.S3(NOx): hourly averaged sensor response for NOx
7. NO2(GT): hourly averaged NO2 concentration in microg/m3
8. PT08.S4(NO2): hourly averaged sensor response for NO2
9. PT08.S5(O3): hourly averaged sensor response for O3
10. T: Temperature in C
11. RH: Relative Humidity
12. AH: Absolute Humidity
13. PT08.S1(CO): TARGET VARIABLE - hourly averaged sensor response for CO
